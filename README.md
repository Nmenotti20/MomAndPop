### Project Description

Small Businesses will be able to create a Local Small Business Owner Account and post their business logos, contact information, location, menus and marketing information as well as show their location on a map on the app so that consumers can find and support them by bringing them business.
 
Consumers will be able to create a Consumer Account to search for Local Small Businesses, post photos, and reviews and comment on small businesses experiences so that other consumers may see the reviews and determine if they would like to support that business also. 


#### User Story
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
As a Buisiness Owner 
I am looking for a tool to connect me with other buisnesses with capabilities to generate new clients and buisness partners in related industries
so that I may do buisness with them.
